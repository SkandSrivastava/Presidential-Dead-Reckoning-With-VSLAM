# Presidential-Dead-Reckoning-With-VSLAM
It is our final-year project.

Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) is an innovative navigation technique developed to precisely track the movement and location of individuals in environments where conventional positioning systems, including the Global Positioning System (GPS), may be either unavailable or unreliable.           
Utilizing Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM), we aim to address and overcome the challenges encountered in Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR).
